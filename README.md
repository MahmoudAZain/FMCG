# El-Gomala — الجملة

**Egyptian grocery e-commerce, Arabic-first.**

A bilingual (Arabic-default, RTL) grocery storefront and staff admin console for the Egyptian
market. Cash on delivery only, fulfilled by an in-house fleet. The site's job is to capture
correct orders cheaply and safely.

**Status**: Stages 1–2 complete — Next.js on Cloudflare Workers with a bilingual Arabic-first
RTL shell, and the full data layer with 103 passing SQL assertions. Stage 3 (storefront) is next.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev              # http://localhost:3000 → /ar
npm run cf:build && npx wrangler dev    # the real Workers bundle
supabase start && supabase db reset     # schema + seed
./scripts/run-sql-tests.sh              # pricing, orders, transitions, RLS
./scripts/test-concurrency.sh           # two orders race for the last unit
```

## The decisions that shape everything

1. **Orders have no `INSERT` policy for any role.** The only way an order comes into existence
   is `place_order()`, a `SECURITY DEFINER` function that recomputes every amount from stored
   data under row locks. The browser sends product IDs and quantities — nothing else. Prices
   cannot be tampered with because there is no path by which a client writes one.

2. **Cost prices live in a separate table with no grant to customers or staff.** A restricted
   column would depend on every query, forever, remembering to omit it. A table nobody has a
   grant on cannot leak.

3. **All money is integer piastres.** A one-piastre floating-point drift is a cash dispute at
   the door when the driver collects.

4. **Phone-only auth with no SMS and no email.** Numbers normalize to `+201XXXXXXXXX` and map
   to a synthetic internal identifier over Supabase Auth, keeping password hashing, JWTs and
   `auth.uid()` in RLS. The trade-off — no self-service password reset — is handled by a
   staff-mediated reset with an audit trail.

## Build order

| Stage | Delivers |
|---|---|
| 1. Foundation ✅ | Next.js on Workers, Supabase project, RTL shell, CI |
| 2. Data layer ✅ | 15 tables, RLS, pricing and order functions, tests |
| 3. Storefront 🎯 | Register, browse, cart, checkout — **MVP, real orders** |
| 4. Admin | Products, categories, brands, promotions, governorates |
| 5. Order operations | Staff queue and transitions; customer tracking |
| 6. Reporting | Dashboard, sales/customer/promotion reports, CSV and Excel export |
| 7. Discovery | Arabic/English search, offers, scheduled jobs, hardening |

Stage 2 precedes all UI because the correctness and isolation guarantees are database-resident.
Stages 3 and 4 can run in parallel. Stage 6 follows stage 5 because there is nothing to report
until orders run their full lifecycle.

## Confirmed decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Order flow | Customer creates the order → ops team sees it → confirms by phone → marks confirmed → through to delivered |
| Backups | **Free tier** plus the weekly export job (T117). Worst case is losing up to a week; revisit when order history becomes critical |
| SMS verification | **Not needed for v1** — phone plus password, staff-mediated password reset |
| Delivery coverage | **Cairo and Giza** at launch; all 27 governorates pre-loaded in the admin, activated with a fee and a minimum as coverage grows |
| Deferred | Delivery time slots, coupon codes, cross-device cart sync — all additive later |

## Known risk

The Supabase free tier provides **no backups**, and the business has chosen to launch on it. The
weekly export job (T117) is therefore the only recovery point, and is required rather than
optional. Point-in-time recovery would need the $25/month Pro tier.
